## About
This application manages and sorts transactions. Enter a transaction amount then click the "Deposit" or "Withdraw" buttons. The transaction is then output to the console window with the day, date and time of the transaction. The transactions can be sorted from lowest to highest amount with either the selection sort or insertion sort algorithms. Simply select the sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu and click "Sort".The transactions are then sorted and output to the console window. The selection sort and insertion sort algorithms are implemented using a combination of the factory method pattern and the strategy pattern. Lastly, to export the transactions to an XML file click the "To File" button.
